--------

### Libraries

#### `os`

##### `WireReader`

* Fixed reading a `Float32` from a `Float64` (#2227).
  This is not a common use case, but it can happen when a `Float32` is written
  on a file, and then read again into YARP (as a `Float64`), and then restored
  in the original type using `copyPortable()`.
